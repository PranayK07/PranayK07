## 🚀 Projects & Research

### **🔬 ML Research Intern @ UConn** (Summer 2024)  

I assisted in research on **privacy-preserving cryptographic systems using biometric data** at UConn, contributing to the development and evaluation of new fuzzy extractor techniques for iris recognition. I supported experimental setup, data analysis, and literature review for the paper:

📄 *“Fuzzy Extractors are Practical: Cryptographic Strength Key Derivation from the Iris”* (Ahmad, Fuller, et al., 2025)  

This work introduces **ClearEyes**, a high-entropy key derivation pipeline with improved security and accuracy for iris biometrics, correcting previous errors in the fuzzy extractor literature.

### **🧪 McCarron Physics Lab @ UConn** (Summer 2023)  

I worked as a research assistant in the **McCarron Group** at UConn, contributing to a portable Magneto-Optical Trap (MOT) demo for lithium atoms. Modeled the relationship between **laser diode temperature and emission wavelength** using **Python & linear regression** to ensure precise tuning

Although physics-adjacent, this project deepened my interest in **hardware-oriented programming**, **data modeling**, and **instrumentation**, skills I plan to build upon in **computer engineering and embedded systems**.
